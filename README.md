# Resources for Beginner Front-End Programmers - Curriculum

This is a static website with a few different lessons that teach HTML and CSS for beginners. The homepage displays all of the lessons available with descriptions, and icons that link to the lessons' practice webpages, code, and slideshows for learning material.

As of now, two lessons (the lessons that cover HTML only) are complete.
